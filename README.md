- Implement gravity, jumping, and collision with platforms
- Use a dedicated Camera2D class for smooth horizontal tracking
- Support multiple levels and easy tuning through data files
- Explore scalable project architecture for larger games
- Make it easier to implement new things to inporve as time goes on
